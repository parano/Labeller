As you start registering new callbacks 
for your models, they will be queued for execution. 
This queue will include all your modelâ€™s validations, 
the registered callbacks, and the database operation to be executed.

The whole callback chain is wrapped in a transaction. 
If any before callback method returns exactly false or raises an exception, the execution chain gets halted and a ROLLBACK is issued;
after callbacks can only accomplish that by raising an exception.
