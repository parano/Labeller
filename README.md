# Labeller

Labeller is a web tool for researchers in Machine Learning or related area, to quickly and collaboratively label large scale of text data. It also integrated with the Knowledge Base System that used in other Yeezhao Projects.

I developed this project in early 2012 while I was in the internship at Summba Inc, a startup company providing social media data analysis service.

This project is developed using Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and MySQL.
